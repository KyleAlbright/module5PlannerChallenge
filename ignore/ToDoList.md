# HTML
________________________________________________________________________
 * Need to make sure we have all the correct Jquery / Bootstrap / Moment JS linked in the HTML. We may need some inline script for this project.

 * Will need to link any local JS or CSS we are using.

 * Need to set up a container that will hold all our hours from 9:00AM - 5:00PM. These will need to match the class names already set up in the CSS. It looks like class names are for CSS and ID's are for JS in this case. 

 * 12 columns 2 for the time, 8 for the text area, 2 for the save button
   |  TIME   |          Text Area                 | Save Btn |
        2                    8                          2

Class names are for CSS it looks like


# JavaScript

# ToDo List

* set up containers / divs for the hour blocks in bootstrap.
* set up div id's so we are able to access the time blocks, and tie them to the user input
* an if / else if / else statement to color code the time blocks
* A function that will reset the app every minute
* setItem / getItem for the user input.

# Module 5 Challenge - Kyle Albright

## User Story / Acceptance Criteria
```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

```

## Usage

When the user is presented with the schedule they can see the current date displayed at the top, and time blocks for normal buisness hours.(9AM-5PM) If the user is using the application during that time, the time blocks will be color coded. Grey for time in the past, red for time in the present, and green for time in the future. The app updates every minute to keep this current. If the user adds an event to the daily planner, it will be stored into local storage and be displayed.
